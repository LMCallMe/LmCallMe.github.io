# 简介

* `roscd` - change directory starting with package, stack, or location name

* `rospd` - pushd equivalent of roscd

* `rosd` - lists directories in the directory-stack

* `rosls` - list files of a ros package

* `rosed` - edit a file in a package

* `roscp` - copy a file from a package

* `rosrun` - run executables of a ros package

# 详细说明
***
## roscd

roscd allows you to change directories using a package name, stack name, or special location.

Usage:
``` shell
roscd <package-or-stack>[/subdir]
```
For example:
``` shell
roscd roscpp
```
You can continue to use a relative path after the package name to go further into the package:
``` shell
roscd roscpp/include/ros
```
roscd without argument will take you to `$ROS_WORKSPACE`.

Additionally, the `ROS_LOCATIONS` environment variable can be used to add additional special locations for use with roscd. `ROS_LOCATIONS` is a colon-separated list of `key=path` pairs.

For example, adding the following to your `.bashrc` file:
``` shell
export ROS_LOCATIONS="pkgs=~/ros/pkgs:dev=~/ros/dev"
```
Will then allow you to type:
``` shell
$ roscd dev
```
and end up in `~/ros/dev`.

## rospd
***
`rospd` is the pushd equivalent of `roscd`. It allows you to keep multiple locations in a directory-stack while still using ros package names. You can then use the number of any directory in your directory stack to jump back there.

For example:
``` shell
leibs@bar:~$ rospd hokuyo_node/
0 ~/ros/pkgs/laser_drivers/hokuyo_node
1 ~
leibs@bar:~/ros/pkgs/laser_drivers/hokuyo_node$ rospd roscpp_tutorials/
0 ~/ros/pkgs/ros_tutorials/roscpp_tutorials
1 ~/ros/pkgs/laser_drivers/hokuyo_node
2 ~
leibs@bar:~/ros/pkgs/ros_tutorials/roscpp_tutorials$ rospd laser_pipeline/
0 ~/ros/dev/laser_pipeline
1 ~/ros/pkgs/ros_tutorials/roscpp_tutorials
2 ~/ros/pkgs/laser_drivers/hokuyo_node
3 ~
leibs@bar:~/ros/dev/laser_pipeline$ rospd 1
0 ~/ros/pkgs/ros_tutorials/roscpp_tutorials
1 ~/ros/pkgs/laser_drivers/hokuyo_node
2 ~
3 ~/ros/dev/laser_pipeline
```
## rosd
***
`rosd` lists the directories in your directory stack. This is for use with `rospd`.

For example:
``` shell
leibs@bar:~/ros/pkgs/laser_drivers/hokuyo_node$ rosd
0 ~/ros/pkgs/laser_drivers/hokuyo_node
1 ~
2 ~/ros/dev/laser_pipeline
```
## rosls
***
`rosls` allows you to view the contents of a package, stack, or location.

For example:
``` shell
$ rosls roscpp
$ rosls roscpp/include/ros
```
## rosed
***
`rosed` allows you to easily edit files in a ROS package by typing the package name and the name of the file you want to edit:
``` shell
$ rosed roscpp_tutorials add_two_ints_server.cpp
```
Note: you can specify ANY file in a package, including those further down within the file hierarchy. If you specify an ambiguous file you will be prompted to select one.

For example:
``` shell
$ rosed roscpp CMakeLists.txt
You have chosen a non-unique filename, please pick one of the following:
1) ~/ros/ros/core/roscpp/test/CMakeLists.txt
2) ~/ros/ros/core/roscpp/CMakeLists.txt
3) ~/ros/ros/core/roscpp/src/CMakeLists.txt
4) ~/ros/ros/core/roscpp/src/libros/CMakeLists.txt
```

The default editor for rosed is `vim`. To use a different editor, set the `EDITOR` environment variable. E.g., in your `~/.bashrc`:
``` shell
export EDITOR='emacs -nw'
```
This example makes emacs the default editor.

You also can change the editor for one rosed call on the fly:

`EDITOR=geany rosed rosbash rosbash`

## roscp
***
`roscp` allows you to conveniently copy a file from a package. Similar to rosed you can specify any file in the package regardless of hierarchy.

For example:
``` shell
$ roscp roscpp_tutorials talker.cpp .
```
Will end up copying the file from `~/ros/pkgs/ros_tutorials/roscpp_tutorials/talker/talker.cpp`

## rosrun
***
rosrun allows you to run an executable in an arbitrary package from anywhere without having to give its full path or `cd`/`roscd` there first.

Usage:
``` shell
rosrun <package> <executable>
```
Example:
``` shell
rosrun roscpp_tutorials talker
```
It's also possible to pass a `~`parameter using the following syntax (replace the `~` with an `_`):
``` shell
rosrun package node _parameter:=value
```
Example:
``` shell
rosrun my_package my_node _my_param:=value
```
Starting in Indigo, rosrun has a `--prefix` option which can be used to run a node in `gdb` or `valgrind`.

Example:
``` shell
rosrun --prefix 'gdb -ex run --args' my_package my_node
```
For more example prefixes, see: Roslaunch Nodes in Valgrind or GDB

# TAB补全
`rosbash` enables tab-completion for its own tools and for a number of other ros utilities:

`rosmake`, `roslaunch`, `rosparam`, `rosnode`, `rostopic`, `rosservice`, `rosmsg`, `rossrv`, `rosbag`.
